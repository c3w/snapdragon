    DESCRIPTION
        "power supply redundancy modes.  valid values are:

        notsupported(1):  Operational state only, indicates
            that the requested administrative state (redundant(2)
            or combined(3)) is not supported by the system.
        
        redundant(2):  A single power supply output can power
            the entire system, although there may be more than
            one supply in the system.  For example, a system with 
            one 1000-watt supply and one 1300-watt supply would
            be rated to power 1000-watts of FRUs.
        
        combined(3):  The combined output of the power supplies
            are available to operate the system.  For example, 
            two 1000-watt supplies in combined-mode supply 2000

        on(1):  Turn FRU on.
        off(2): Turn FRU off.

        The inline power means that the FRU itself won't cost any power,
        but the external device connecting to the FRU will drain the
        power from FRU.  For example, the IP phone device.  The FRU is a
        port of a switch with voice ability and IP phone will cost power
        from the port once it connects to the port.

        inlineAuto(3): Turn FRU inline power to auto mode. It means that
        the FRU will try to detect whether the connecting device needs
        power or not.  If it needs power, the FRU will supply power.  If
        it doesn't, the FRU will treat the device as a regular network
        device.

        inlineOn(4): Turn FRU inline power to on mode.  It means that
        once the device connects to the FRU, the FRU will always supply
        power to the device no matter the device needs the power or not.
