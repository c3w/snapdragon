        DESCRIPTION
                "This MIB module manages the GPRS Tunnelling Protocol
                (GTP) on GGSN and SGSN.

                GPRS provides wireless access to packet data network on
                the GSM infrastructure.

                The following diagram illustrates a simplified GPRS
                logical architecture with the name of inter-node
                interface:

                GTP is the protocol between GSN nodes (GSN peers) in
                the GPRS backbone network. It includes both the GTP
                signalling and data transfer procedures.

                GTP is used both on the Gn interface, i.e. the interface
                between GSN peers with in a PLMN, and the Gp
                interface between GSN peers in different PLMNs.
 
                SGSN is the serving GPRS support node, it responsible 
                for the delivery of data packets from and to the MS 
                within its service area.

                GGSN is the gateway GPRS support node, it provides 
                interworking with external PDN and is connected with 
                SGSNs via an IP-based GPRS backbone network.

                The GTP protocol is implemented only by SGSNs and GGSN.

                A PDP Context is an information set maintained by MS 
                and GSNs which describes the mobile wireless service
                call or session.

                A Qos Profile is associated with each PDP context which
                defines multiple attributes like precedence, delay, 
                reliability, peak throughput and mean throughput.
                Based on the precedence, delay and mean throughput an
                user is classified into one of the three Qos classes:
                Best Effort, Normal and Premium.
                
                Mean throughput is measured at the Gi and R reference 
                points in units of octets per second. It specifies the 
                average rate at which data is expected to be 
                transferred across the GPRS network during the 
                remaining lifetime of an activated PDP context.
                
                A MAP converting GSN is responsible for converting GTP
                messages to and from MAP messages.  This helps in the
                communication with HLR.

        REVISION       "200109131535Z"
        DESCRIPTION
                 "Modified the default value for cGtpMaximumPdps from 
                 1000 to 10000.

                 Added 'gtpdirector' to the enumeration of cGtpService.

                 The APN identifies whether the network is corporate 
                 or service provider network.  

                 The Single Access point feature enables the
                 service provider to add new access-points to the GGSN
                 without having to provision the HLR. The requests are
                 sent by the SGSN to the same virtual APN. A virtual
                 APN is not associated with any actual physical
                 network.  The GGSN processes the request and forwards
                 the packet to the appropriate access-point that is
                 specified in the PCO. This feature is supported only
                 in Cisco GGSNs.

                 The purpose of the GTP-Director is to provide a
                 mechanism for service providers using non-Cisco GGSN
                 to use the Single APN feature.

                 The GTP-Director also provides load balancing, using 
                 round robin mechanism, across GGSNs.  The
                 Cisco GGSNs may use the GTP-Director, but is not
                 necessary as they can use IOS-SLB ( Server Load
                 Balancing ).
