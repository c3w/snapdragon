        DESCRIPTION
              "This table facilitates the creation and deletion of a
               Port Channel interface to achieve higher bandwidths
               than just one E_port. More than one E_port can be a 
               member of an Port Channel port.
               NOTE:Only E_ports can be members of an Port Channel
               port.
               
               A port is added to a Port Channel port by setting 
               portChannelMemberList,and the 'manner' in which the 
               agent performs the type of addition is determined 
               by the value of portChannelAddType.
               
               During the period when port(s) is being added to the
               Port Channel, the agent will not allow to change any 
               parameters of the port(s) being added. Also if the 
               operation is successful (i.e. port(s) is added to the 
               Port Channel) then also the agent will not allow to 
               change any parameters of the individual port(s) that is
               added. But any change done to the Port Channel port
               will also be applied to the port(s) which are member(s)
               of this Port channel port. Once a port(s) is removed
               from a Port Channel Port it will retain the values that
               it had when it was a member of the Port Channel port.
               It will not have the old values it had before joining
               the Port Channel port. 

               The port(s) that are added/removed to/from a 
               Port Channel port will be put into administratively
               down (ifAdminStatus='down') which results into
               operationally down(ifOperStatus='down'). To bring the 
               port up again, the user has to set the port to be
               administratively up(ifAdminStatus='up'). Then the port
               goes through its initialization cycle to become 
               active(ifOperStatus='up'). "
