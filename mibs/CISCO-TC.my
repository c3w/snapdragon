CiscoLocationSpecifier ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS    current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Use this TC to define objects that indicate the
        physical entity and/or logical interface location 
        of a managed entity on a managed device. In SNMP, a 
        standard mechanism for indicating the physical location
        of entities is via the ENTITY-MIB. However, that approach
        is not satisfactory in some cases because:

        1. The entity requiring a location-based naming may be 
           associated with an entity which can not be represented 
           as a physical entity in the ENTITY-MIB,
        2. NMS applications may desire a more direct 
           name/representation of a physical entity than is 
           available via the ENTITY-MIB, e.g., a physical entity
           which is named via a hierarchy of levels in the ENTITY-MIB.

        The value of an object defined using this TC is an ASCII 
        string consisting of zero or more elements separated by 
        commas. Each element is of the form <tag> = <value>. 

        An example of this syntax is 'slot=5,port=3'.

        The syntax of the string is formally specified using
        ABNF notation (with one exception, noted below), as
        follows:                 

        location-specifier =  elem *(',' elem) 
                       ; subject to 
                       ; size restriction specified in the SYNTAX
                       ; clause below

        elem    =   loctype '=' number

        number  = %x00-FFFFFFFF / %d0-4294967295

        loctype = 1*32VCHAR 

        It is recommended that loctype use one of the enumerated
        labels defined for CiscoLocationClass.

        (NOTE: To conform to ABNF notation as defined in RFC2234, 
         substitute the single-quote symbol with a double-quote 
         symbol in the above rules.)

        A zero length of CiscoLocationSpecifier is object-specific
        and must be defined as part of the description of any object
        which uses this syntax.

CiscoInetAddressMask ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Denotes a generic Internet subnet address mask.
        The Internet subnet address mask is represented as the
        number of contiguous 1-bit from MSB (most significant bit)
        of the Internet subnet address mask.
        A CiscoInetAddressMask value is always interpreted within
        the context of an InetAddressType value. The 
        InetAddressType only object or InetAddressType with
        InetAddress objects which define the context must be
        registered immediately before the object which uses the
        CiscoInetAddressMask textual convention.  In other words,
        the object identifiers for the InetAddressType object and
        the CiscoInetAddressMask object MUST have the same length
        and the last sub-identifier of the InetAddressType object
        MUST be 1 less than the last sub-identifier of the 
        CiscoInetAddressMask object and MUST be 2 less than the
        last sub-identifier of the CiscoInetAddressMask object if
        an InetAddress object is defined between InetAddressType
        and CiscoInetAddressMask objects.
        The maximum value of the CiscoInetAddressMask TC is 32 for
        the value 'ipv4(1)' in InetAddressType object and 128 for
        the value 'ipv6(2)' in InetAddressType object.
        The value zero is object-specific and must therefore be
        defined as part of the description of any object which
        uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of zero might
        include situations where Internet subnet mask was unknown,
        or when none subnet masks need to be referenced."

		taken in order to prevent a more serious (for
		example, service or safety affecting) condition.

	    warning(6) -
		Indicates the detection of a potential or impending
		service or safety affecting condition, before any
		significant effects have been felt.
