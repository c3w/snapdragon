        This MIB provides Port Access Entity information that are

        "Add SNMP support for the Multiple Authentication and
         and Guest Vlan features.
         
         The objects cpaeMultipleHost has been deprecated, and 
         cpaePortMode has been added to cpaePortTable to support
         for Multiple Authentication feature. The object 
         cpaeGuestVlanId has been added to support for Guest Vlan
